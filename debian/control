Description: tools for internationalizing Python applications - Python 2.x
 Babel is composed of two major parts. First tools to build and work with
 gettext message catalogs. Second a Python interface to the CLDR (Common
 Locale Data Repository), providing access to various locale display
 names, localized number and date formatting, etc.
